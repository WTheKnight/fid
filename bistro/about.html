<h1><u>About</u> Black Goose Bistro &amp; <u>Contact</u> </h1>

<p>Chef Jen, here! The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. <i>Bon Appetit!</i></p>

<p>The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.</p>

<p>If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at <b>jen@example.com.</b></p>

<p>If you need to reach out to for inquiries pertaining to the restauraunt, the restauraunt email is <b>blackgoose@example.com.</b> The phone number is <b>555-336-1800.</b></p>

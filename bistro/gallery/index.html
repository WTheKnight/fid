<h1>Blackstone Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here. <br><b>Click on any of the pictures for a closer look!</b></p> 

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
<br>We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. <br>Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="burgers.html"><img src="thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="juicy burgers on a cutting board" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
  <br>People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. <br>Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="fish.html"><img src="thumbnails/fish-200.jpg" alt="baked fish with potatoes and cherry tomatoes" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
  <br>Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. <br>Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>A Perfect Side</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt="crispy long fries served with a side of ketchup" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
  <br>A tried and true choice, our crispy and crunchy french fries goes well with any entree.

<h2>Need an appetizer?</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg" alt="battered and friend chicken wings" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
  <br>Before picking out your main course, consider choosing one of many flavors of our battered, fried chicken wings.

<h2>Our Salads</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="Levantine salad made mostly of finely chopped parsley" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
  <br>If our fried sides are not to your liking, we also serve unique salads like our tabouleh. <br>Tabouleh is a Levantine salad made mostly of finely chopped parsley, with tomatoes, mint, onion, soaked uncooked bulgur, and seasoned with olive oil.

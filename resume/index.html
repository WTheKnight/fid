    At the time of writing this, I am finishing my last year at Seminole State College, graduating in December, and transfering to University of Central Florida in the spring term. 
    <br>During my tenure at SSC, I've taken many design, interactive media, and multimedia classes that range from composing my own videos and social media reels to doing traditional and digital art.
    <br>Outside of schooling, I've always had a passion of being a creator. My hobbies include Cosplay, Voice Over, Art (traditional, but mostly digital), Dungeons & Dragons, and Video Games.

<p>Here are <i>some</i> skills of mine that I've developed throughout my creative career.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Productive - I worked nightly on a mural I painted for a Jeremiah's Italian Ice store - physically painted.</li>
    <li>Creative and Artistic - I've been drawing, inking, and coloring my own illustrations for several years at this point.</li>

    <li>Good Communication Skills - I am able to talk to people one on one in uncomfortable or even confrontational environments. I am able to lead and delegate tasks to my peers. I can communicate ideas and inspire.</li>
